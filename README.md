Comments for testing
-----------------------------------------

- Added two folders to src/androidTest for UI and VM testing
- I think UI will be more straightforward but I was wondering about the best approach for the VM's
- Just as an idea, for the login VM, would it work to have it return false/true for successful credentials?
- mocks?
- this also may not be top priority
